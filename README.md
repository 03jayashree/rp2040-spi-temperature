# SPI based Digital Temperature Monitor using RP2040
This project demonstrates how to use the RP2040â€™s PIO (Programmable I/O) as an SPI slave to transmit internal temperature sensor data to a master device. It is written in MicroPython, and developed using Thonny IDE on a Raspberry Pi Pico demoboard.

For more details on GPIO pin functions and internal peripheral mappings, refer to the official [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf).Each GPIO pin on the RP2040 is connected to various internal peripherals (like SPI,UART,I2C etc.) , offering high flexibility for custom I/O functions.SIO, PIO0 and PIO1 are connected to all GPIO pins and are controlled by software (or software controlled state machines) so can be used to implement
many functions.
