# rp2040-spi-temperature

This project demonstrates how to use the RP2040â€™s PIO (Programmable I/O) as an SPI slave to transmit internal temperature sensor data to a master device. It is designed for the Tiny Tapeout 6 board, written in MicroPython, and developed using Thonny IDE on a Raspberry Pi.
