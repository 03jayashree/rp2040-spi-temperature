# rp2040-spi-temperature
A MicroPython-based SPI slave implementation using the RP2040's PIO to transmit internal temperature data  to a master device. Designed for integration with the Tiny Tapeout 6 board.
.This project demonstrates how to use the RP2040â€™s PIO (Programmable I/O) as an SPI slave to transmit internal temperature sensor data to a master device. It is designed for the Tiny Tapeout 6 board, written in MicroPython, and developed using Thonny IDE on a Raspberry Pi.
